Hotel Management System Network Design
This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a hotel management system network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network simulates a real-world hotel environment with multiple departments, secure segmentation, and wireless access.

Project Overview
The network is divided into logical segments for different hotel departments, ensuring security, performance, and organized management. It includes:

Reception
Administration
IT Department
Security Room
Logistics
Store
Sales
HR
Finance
Wireless Guest Access
Key Features
VLAN Configuration
Isolated VLANs for each department to improve security and reduce broadcast domains.
Inter-VLAN Routing
Configured routers to allow controlled communication between VLANs.
Redundancy
Dual-router setup providing failover paths for network reliability.
Wireless Network
Access Points configured for smartphones, tablets, and laptops.
Peripheral Integration
Printers, servers, and other devices connected and assigned to appropriate VLANs.
Subnetting
Efficient IP addressing to manage departmental networks.
Secure Access
Segmentation to restrict unauthorized access between departments.
Technologies and Tools
Cisco Packet Tracer
Routing (Static/Dynamic)
Access Control
Wireless Access Configuration
